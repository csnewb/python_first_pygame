The game can be controlled via the mouse or the keyboard.

Keyboard:
A, S, D, F or Arrow Keys

F1 to toggle on the mouse control (probably the best way to play in my opinion)

------------------ The Basics  --------------------------------
Your goal is to collect the Food (The Yellow Blocks) while avoiding all other obstacles.

If you collide with an obstacle, you will take damage... it will be alot... and it will be fast.

Your score is your health. If your score reaches zero it will be game over. 

Every second, your score will be decreased slightly. 

Every time you collect Food, you are rewarded with more points to your score.

Every 5 times you collect Food, you will be rewarded with Shields. Your character will change to Purple.

While you have Shields, you score will not be decreased if you collide with an obstacle, but your Shields will be decreased.

Once your Shields have been used up, you will begin to decrease your Score again. 

----------------  Difficulty Level  ---------------------------

Every 25 levels, the game increases in Difficulty level. 

The amount of damage taken from time and collissions is multiplied by the Difficulty Level.

The amount of shields is slightly increased with each difficulty level 

Every difficulty level a new Bouncing Obstacle is introduced with a random trajectory.

Each difficulty level the new Bouncing Obstacle size is increased as well.
